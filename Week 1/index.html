        <p>I live in Quetzaltenango Guatemala. I served a mission in my country and I was able to know some wonderful
        that I like to share with others. </p>
        <p>I love technology and how it helps us to be more practical and efficient in our activities. That's why I decided to study program development.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ all my life and am grateful for the gospel and the opportunity to increase our knowledge,</p>
        <p>I have no doubt that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I love listening to music, comics and pizza</p>
